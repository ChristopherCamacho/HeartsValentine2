Dear Jo,
I am really annoyed with you. Why didnâ€™t you give me money yesterday? I am really short of funds. You know I have a propensity to gamble money. I like gambling, You knew I gambled before our marriage so why did you marry me? I thought you loved me. I am so distressed about your talk of divorcing last night. 
I know I drink and I meet up in the pub every evening so I can join the lads. How am I going to manage without your helpâ€‹? I am already on benefit and unemployed. As I told you my last employer was really horrible. It is not my fault if my mates detained me every evening so I kept coming at work late. My boss complained I made too many mistakes and spent most of my days chatting with Mrs Pennypeg the secretary. I was only trying to help her.
I hope you will have some pity. I feel so sorry for myself.
T
